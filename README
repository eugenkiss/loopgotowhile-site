Limiting Resources
------------------

Also the computation will time out if it takes longer than five seconds.

These options make the executable static and limit the heap size to 5m.

TODO: Put this in cabal

ghc -O2 --make -static -optc-static -optl-static LGWServer.hs -fvia-C -optl-pthread +RTS -M5m


To limit the cpu resources you can use the program `cpulimit`

-----

If you get an error like mkTextEncoding: invalid argument from the statically-linked binaries, try setting the GCONV_PATH environment variable to point to the location of the codecs from the libc package, e.g. /usr/lib/gconv; see http://blog.malde.org/index.php/2010/05/22/snagged/

put `export GCONV_PATH=/usr/lib/gconv` at the top of your bashrc on the remote.


Very flaky to get both processes LGWServer and cpulimit running with fabric. Only
works every fourth time or so.
