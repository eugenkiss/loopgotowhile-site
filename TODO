- Content / Design 
    - Maybe use Templating Engine to extract content from index.html
    - use this javascript script editor with highlighting and line numbers see other Todo of loopgotowhile
    - make error red
    - put all the style in css
- I dont' like the current way of limiting computations with mvar. There is one
  global, although it would be enough if there was one per user
- create readme
- push to github as loopgotowhile-site
