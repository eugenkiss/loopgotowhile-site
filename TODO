- make error red (make parse error also error in code)
- finish content
- create readme
- push to github as loopgotowhile-site
- I dont' like the current way of limiting computations with mvar. There is one
  global, but I would like to have like 4 global MVars and only if all are
  not empty not allow compuation or have an MVar that is local to a process (or
  is it by default?), so that when I have 2 processes 2 concurrent compuatoins
  can occure but no more.
- codemirror.net
    - put focus automatically on editor
    - switch modes when selecting another input language or checking strict
    - write loop, loope, while, whilee, goto, gotoe modes
        - change enterMode from "keep" to "indent" and tabMode from "shift" to "indent"
- maybe change to yesod
