- There is a problem with customizing the scrollbar with css. If I make body
  position absolute I get a nice styled scrollbar, but the navigation links
  don't work, i.e. they don't jump to a section. If I don't make body absolute,
  then the nav links work, but the scrollbar is not there or goes batshit insane...
